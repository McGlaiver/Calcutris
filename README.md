# Calcutris
An Unreal engine C++ brain excercise game

Developed in Unreal Engine 4.25.

The game is a variation of the old Tetris game. Instead of shapes, boxes with numbers are falling down. Boxes have different colors, each color has different bonus value and it's spawn chance can be edited in Unreal Engine. The colors are plain, red, blue, green and there is a special Explosive box, which removes all the numbers in given explosion radius.

The goal of the game is to match falling numbers in a way to create a mathematical equation between two numbers to equal a given number as a result. Addition and substraction are worth 1 times the points, multiplication and division is worth double the points, furthermore if the right color is matched as well points are further multiplied by 2 for plain, 3 for red, 4 for blue and 5 for green. Explosive box gives flat amount of 50 points regardless of the amount of boxes destroyed.

Each time player does 5 right equations level increases, increasing falling speed. at level 5 and 10 higher numbers are introduced.

If a player does 5 right equations in a row the following score reward is doubled.
